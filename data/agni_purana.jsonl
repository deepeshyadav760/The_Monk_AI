So also there is no study after eating, with wethands, remaining in waters, at midnight, and on the days when there is excess of wind, dust storm, morbid heat, the fall of snow and at the time of twilight and while having other fears. So also there is no study while running or being disturbed by animals or when a great person has comehomeor while climbing a mule, camel, vehicle, elephant, horse, boat and tree.
